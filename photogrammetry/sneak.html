        <h1>My 3D Capture Experience</h1>
        <p>Sarah Dolgin</p>
        <p>Honestly, I did not have the easiest time when I was working to capture a 3D model of my very cool new sneaker. I am very clumsy, so I kept tripping over myself and blurring a part of the image during the capturing process. I tried out scanning different items in my apartment, and after a few tries found the sneaker to look the best. It was really interesting to watch the application work from the various angles of the sneaker as I circled around it, and I pictured the sphere of pinpoints that the application was marking behind the scenes as it planned for the creation  of a virtual reality-friendly model.</p>
        <p> In journalism, it would be really incredible to be able to use this kind of technology to create deliverables to further the resonance of reporting tough topics. The examples we saw in class of the scans of different items, locations and people in Ukraine opened my mind to the way that these models could be used to preserve moments in time and tell important stories that otherwise would be lost in the rubble.</p> 
        <p>I could image myself implementing this in a variety of ways: it could be amazing to do this for an arts and culture story package like the student example from last year where the gallery was scanned and adapted for augemented reality, it could also be really awesome to take scans of places that are at risk â€” cities that could soon be under water due to global warminng or destroyed from natural disasters could be digitally preserved and experienced in this way. Endangered plants could be documented in this way, and even skeletons of dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures could make for really interesting 3D models presenting great opporunities for education and storytelling.  </p>
        <p>In the future, I hope I can use this kind of technology to create immersive reporting experiences. If I am so lucky as to travel and report in another country, it would be really incredible to take 3D scans of different areas that I am covering so that readers can have a better understanding and perspective of my atmosphere. For example, if I am in Italy covering a story about a historic vineyard that is about to be built over and destroyed, it would be really cool to be able to capture the different scenes of the vineyard and complement these 3D elements with the traditional interviews and other multimedia storytelling devices to honor the narrative I am sharing.</p>

        <strong>This is my new sneaker that I want to share. People are already saving the image, which is very strange but cool!</strong>
